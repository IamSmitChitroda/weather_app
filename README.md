# Weather App

## Project Definition

**Sky Scrapper** is a feature-rich weather application built using Flutter, incorporating key concepts such as API calling, Shared Preferences, and network connectivity. The app offers a comprehensive set of functionalities designed to provide users with accurate and timely weather information for cities, states, and countries.

## Project Description

"Sky Scrapper" aims to be a reliable and user-friendly weather application, empowering users with accurate and timely weather information. By incorporating API calling, Shared Preferences, network connectivity checks, city/state/country-wise weather details, saved location functionality, light and dark themes, splash screen, and detailed weather screens, the app provides a comprehensive solution for users to stay informed about weather conditions in their desired locations.

## Project Objectives

- **API Calling**: The app utilizes API calls to fetch weather data from reliable weather data providers. This ensures that users receive accurate and up-to-date weather information for their desired locations.
  
- **Shared Preferences**: "Sky Scrapper" incorporates Shared Preferences to enhance the user experience. Users can save specific cities or states of interest, and this information is stored locally. The app provides a dedicated page where users can view their saved locations for quick access to weather details.
  
- **Network Connectivity**: The app includes network connectivity checks to ensure uninterrupted access to weather data. In scenarios where network connectivity is unavailable, the app gracefully handles errors and presents an error screen, notifying the user about the network unavailability and suggesting alternative actions.
  
- **Fetch City/State/Country Wise Weather Detail**: Users can search for weather details by entering the name of a city, state, or country. The app retrieves the relevant weather information and displays it in an organized and user-friendly manner, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant meteorological data.
  
- **Light & Dark Themes**: "Sky Scrapper" offers a visually pleasing experience with customizable themes. Users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences, ensuring comfortable usage in different lighting conditions and personalizing their weather app experience.
  
- **Splash Screen**: The app features an appealing splash screen that creates a positive first impression on users. The splash screen can showcase the app logo, weather-related imagery, or a visually engaging animation, captivating users and setting the tone for their weather exploration.
  
- **Detail Screen for Each City/State Wise Weather Detail**: Each city or state's weather information is presented on a dedicated detail screen. This screen provides a comprehensive overview of the current weather conditions, along with additional details such as hourly and daily forecasts, precipitation chances, and sunrise/sunset times. Users can explore and analyze the weather data in depth for the selected location.
